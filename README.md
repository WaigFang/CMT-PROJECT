# CMT-PROJECT 

## Project description

[Here we want to explain what our program does]

Our program's aim is to study the population growth and change over time of a system consisting of predators and their's preys. Thanks to the Lotka-Volterra equations.

The program will:
1. Read Hare and lynx data found in "*Data/Leigh1968_harelynx.csv*",
2. Generate a table with dH and dL in "*Outputs/dx_dy_data.csv*", and of population in "*Outputs/Lotka_Volterra_Data.csv*",
3. Plot the population over time in "*Outputs/Lotka_Volterra_Simulation.png*",
4. Plot solutions over time in "*Outputs/Lotka_Volterra_Solutions.png*",
5. Plot population density in "*Outputs/Hare_and_Lynx_Density.png*",
6. (SENSIBILITY)

## Project structure
- "*Data/*" contains input data,
- "*Outputs/*" contains program outputs,
- "*Predator_Prey/*" contains program code,
- "*bin/*" contains the shared library between C and Python,
- "*Docs/*" contains a notebook discussing the results and the overall code,

## Inputs and Outputs

Inputs:
- "*Data/Leigh1968_harelynx.csv*" is a 

[Choise of tools]

We used C as our main language, in which we created fonctions, to perform all of the needed calculations, that will be later used in Python. Where we will display the results in the form of plots.

[Ecological Modeling and Research]

**Wildlife Popluation Management**

The program could be used to analyze predator-prey dynamics in different ecosystems. Helping in the design of conservation strategies, such as estimating the impact of predator culling or prey population boosting. 
Parameter values (such as $$\beta$$ ) could reveal insights into the stability or imbalance of the ecosystems. 
Once those parameters are estimated, we could use them to predict future population trends for both species.
