# CMT-PROJECT 

{Project description}

[Here we want to explain what our program does]

Our program's aim is to study the population growth and change over time of a system consisting of predators and their's preys. Thanks to the lotka volterra equations.

**Lotka volterra equations**

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x(t) - \beta x(t)y(t)
$$

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta x(t)y(t) - \gamma y(t)
$$

Where:

- $$x(t)\$$ is the population of prey at time $$\(t\)$$,
- $$y(t)\$$ is the population of predators at time $$\(t\)$$,
- $$\alpha, \beta\, \delta\$$, and $$\gamma\$$  are positive real parameters that describe the interaction between the species.

To achieve our target we take the actual population data of both species and aproximate the constants alpha, beta, delta and gamma needed for the equations.


[Choise of tools]

We used C as our main language, in which we created fonctions, to perform all of the needed calculations, that will be later used in Python. Where we will display the results in the form of plots.
